# Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree

This repository contains projects and exercises from Udacity's Artificial
Intelligence Nanodegree.

The repository is organized as follows:

- [Sudoku](./projects/sudoku/aind-sudoku): AI agent to solve regular Sudoku with
*naked twins* technique and an adaption to solve a variant of regular Sudoku 
called Diagonal Sudoku.

- [Isolation](./projects/isolation): An adversarial search agent that plays the 
game "Isolation". Minmax, AlphaBeta pruning, iterative deepening search
algorithms and custom heuristics were developed. An [heuristic analysis](./projects/isolation/heuristic_analysis.pdf)
is provided alongside with a [research review](./projects/isolation/research_review.pdf).

- [Domain-Independent Planner](./projects/planning): An AI planning search agent that solves
deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system.
Breadth-first, depth-first, and A* algorithms were used to solve planning problems
and a domain-independent planning graph developed for more general problems.  
An [heuristic analysis](./projects/planning/heuristic_analysis.pdf)
is provided alongside with a [research review](./projects/planning/research_review.pdf).

- [ASL Recognizer](./projects/recognizer): an AI agent that leverages 
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to recognize American Sign Language (ASL).
